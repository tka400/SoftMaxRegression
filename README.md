You can follow me on YouTube and write this ML algorithm from scratch in Python

Algorithm for multiclass classification problem, based on Linear Regression with gradient descent.
For multiclass it one hot encode target. The result of that models passed through SoftMax function.
As a predicted class is being selected the highest value.

This implementation plots test train errors

Also plots classification results
